At the end of today's class you should

KNOW:
function definitions mirror data definitions

BE ABLE TO:
write a function over lists of objects

Exercises:

0. Develop data definitions for ListOfCourse and Course (level, department, etc), write a function upperLevelCourses that consumes a list of courses and a department and produces a list of all courses at the 300- or 400-level offered by that department.

1. A phone directory combines names with phone numbers. Develop a data definition for phone records and directories. Using this data definition develop the functions

whoseNumber, which determines the name that goes with some given phone number and phone directory, and

phoneNumber, which determines the phone number that goes with some given name and phone directory.

2. Using the notes from class, develop the function extractMoreThan1, which consumes an inventory and creates an inventory from those records whose prices are above one dollar.

3. Using the notes from class, develop the function recall, which consumes the name of a toy ty and an inventory and produces an inventory that contains all items of the input with the exception of those labeled ty.

4. Write a function, append, which takes two lists of numbers and returns a list of numbers where every element of the first list is before every element of the second list.
  
For example, append(new OneMoreNumber( 1, new OneMoreNumber( 2, new EmptyListOfNumbers () ) ), new OneMoreNumber( 3, new OneMoreNumber( 4, new EmptyListOfNumbers () ) ) ) = new OneMoreNumber( 1, new OneMoreNumber( 2, new OneMoreNumber( 3, new OneMoreNumber( 4, new EmptyListOfNumbers () ) ) ) )

Optional Exercises:

0. Using the notes from class, develop the function nameRobot, which consumes an inventory and produces an inventory with more accurate names. Specifically, it replaces all occurrences of "robot" with "r2d3".
