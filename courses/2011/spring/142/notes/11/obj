KNOW:

BE ABLE TO:
write a function that produces a list

Exercises:

0. Write a function called replaceNegatives that takes a list of numbers and a positive number and produces a list identical to the given list except that all negative numbers in the list have been replaced by the positive number.

1. Write a function called convertFCs that takes a list of Fahrenheit temperatures and produces a list of Celsisu temperatures.

2. Write a function eliminateExpensive that takes a list of toy prices and returns a list with all the elements of the given list, except those that cost more than $10.

3. Write the function nameRobot that takes a list of toy descriptions (strings) and returns a more specific list where "robot" has been replaced with "wally".

4. Generalize #3 to substitute that takes a list of toy descriptions, a target, and new. It replaces all occurrences of the target with the new.

5. Write a function called insert that takes a number and a sorted list of numbers and returns a new sort list of number where the new number is added in the correct spot. [Sorted meaning the numbers go from smallest to largest.]

6. Write a function called sort that takes an unsorted list of numbers and returns a sorted list of numbers. [Hint: Use #5!]
