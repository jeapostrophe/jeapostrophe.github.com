At the end of today's class you should

KNOW:
what is meant a list

BE ABLE TO:
write a data definition for a list
write a function over lists

Exercises:

0. Write a function called containsHuh that determines if a string given as an argument is in a list of strings.

1. Write a function called dollarStoreHuh that determines if every number in a list is less than a dollar

2. Write a function called anyFreezingHuh that determines if any temperature in a list of Fahrenheit temperatures is below freezing.

3. Write a function called convertList that consumes a list of digits and returns the corresponding number. The first digit is the least significant digit. (Refer to convert3 if you are unsure what this means.)

4. Develop the function delta, which consumes two price lists, that is, lists of numbers. The first represents the inventory at the beginning of a time period, the second one the inventory at the end. The function outputs the difference in value. If the value of the inventory has increased, the result is positive; if the value has decreased, it is negative.

5. Develop a function that returns the longest string in a list of strings.

Optional Exercises:

0. Define the function averagePrice. It consumes a list of toy prices and computes the average price of a toy. The average is the total of all prices divided by the number of toys.
