At the end of today's class you should

KNOW:
- What mutation is
- The difference between internal and external mutation
- How to analyze mutation-based programs with store tracking

BE ABLE TO:
- Write basic mutation-based programs
- Use the Java 'while' construct
- Use the Java 'FileReader' class

Exercises:

0. Perform store tracking on this program:

int i = 0;
int j = 1;
i = i + j;
j = j * 4;
i = j - i;
j = i * i;
i = i + j;

1. Write the remove, which takes a name and modifies the address book such that looking up the name in the future will always return false. (Hint: Write in accumulator style first!)

2. Write isPrime, from last exercise, with a while loop.

3. Create a program called letterCount that reads a file and prints out how many characters are in it. Write in accumulator style. (Remember the example we did in class!)

4. Create a program called lineCount that reads a file and prints out how many lines are in it. Write in accumulator style. (Hint: The character for newlines is '\n'.)

5. Create a program called wordCount that reads a file and prints out how many words are in it. Write in accumulator style. Remember, words are separated by one or more spaces. (Hint: The character for a space is ' '.)

6. Convert #3 through #5 to use mutation.

Optional Exercises:

0. Write to10, from last exercise, with a while loop.
