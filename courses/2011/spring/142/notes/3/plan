Guess: Divide by 0

Programs are many definitions
Functions compose with functions
- the one we really want... the main one
- the auxiliary or helpers

Compare un-composed areaOfRing
- no divide and conquer or abstractions

Let's experiment with a problem:

"Imagine the owner of a movie theater who has complete freedom in setting ticket prices. The more he charges, the fewer the people who can afford tickets. In a recent experiment the owner determined a precise relationship between the price of a ticket and average attendance. At a price of $5.00 per ticket, 120 people attend a performance. Decreasing the price by a dime ($.10) increases attendance by 15. Unfortunately, the increased attendance also comes at an increased cost. Every performance costs the owner $180. Each attendee costs another four cents ($0.04). The owner would like to know the exact relationship between profit and ticket price so that he can determine the price at which he can make the highest profit."

What information?
- profits, revenue, costs, attendees

What data?

What depends on what?

Write function headers, contracts, and purposes

Find numbers of attendees for $3, $4, and $5 tickets. What is an equation for this?

How much does it cost to run the show at $3, 4, and 5?

What should we charge?

What if there were no fixed costs, but each attendee cost $1.5?

Give names to all the constants

drop static when naming values inside functions

make a new function to find the best price of three options
- using if and strings
