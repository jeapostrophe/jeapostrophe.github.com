== Arrays ==

[This day is deliberately short, because yesterday might have run long and this is really complicated.]

Some structures are inherently mutable and cannot be constructed any other way.

An array is a homogenous vector of values.

Introduce 'for'

Write sumArray (int[])

Show that it is a length-polymorphic
-- This is why arrays exist, the same thing cannot be done with structures because they always have the same number of pieces

Write sums
-- Replaces each element with itself added to all subsequent elements
-- Write in accumulator style with a helper
-- Translate to a for form
-- Why: We can count down, we can develop with accumulator style and translate, even though there is other mutation going on

Write andArray (boolean[])
-- We can have arrays of everything

Write inPlaceSort (int[])
-- Refer to http://www.htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-53.html (figures 126 and 127, for a referesher)

You are a programmer! Go forth and conquer.

Everything else is just learning the domains of existing libraries people have put together.
