HtDP - Chapter 2.2
---------------

area of a disk of radius r in math

what is area when r = 5?

we can name the value

these math "rules" are functions

write areaOfDisk

once we create functions, they are indistinguishable from what comes with Java

evaluate them with algebra (substitution)
what about areaOfRing

HtDP - Chapter 2.3
-----------------

We rarely turn math into programs

"Company XYZ & Co. pays all its employees $12 per hour. A typical employee works between 20 and 65 hours per week. Develop a program that determines the wage of an employee from the number of hours of work."

What is the actual problem?

12 * h

Discuss errors
