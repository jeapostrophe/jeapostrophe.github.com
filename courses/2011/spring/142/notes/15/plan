family trees were ancestor based

hard to learn about children

let's switch the arrows

but now, people can have multiple children...

parent is info, list of children

count-blue-eyed : parent -> number

has-old-and-blue? : parent number -> boolean [has a blue eyed descedent born before a given data]

count-descendents : parent -> number

descendents : parent -> ListOfInfo

averageAge : parent -> number

truncateTree : parent number -> parent [removes everyone after a generation]

advanced-ages : parent -> parent [update ages by 1]
