Family trees

A child is a father, mother, name, blood type, eyes

This is useless, because we can't construct finite family trees

Person is either a child or unknown

blueEyedAncestorHuh : tree -> boolean

countPersons : tree -> int

eyeColors : tree -> ListOfString [use append]

-- Separate tree into info and left/right

allInfos : tree -> ListOfInfo

oldestMatriach : tree -> Info
