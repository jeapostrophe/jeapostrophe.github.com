At the end of today's class you should

KNOW:
what is meant a list

BE ABLE TO:
write a data definition for a list
write a function over lists

Exercises:

0. Write a data definition for a list of numbers. Then write a function that consumes a list of numbers and produces the product of the numbers. Go through all the steps in the design recipe in the development of your function.

1. Use the data definition for lists of strings from class and create a list of colors that contains at least 5 colors.

2. Use your data definition from #0 and write a function called "containsFiveHuh" that returns true if the number list contains 5.

3. Make a data definition of lists of booleans. Write a function called "allTrueHuh" that is true when all the booleans in a list are true.

4. Use your data definition from #1 and write a function called "longestColourLength" that returns the length of longest color in the the list. (Math.max and someString.length() may be useful.)

Optional Exercises:

0. Using #0, write a function that finds the length of a list of numbers.

1. Using #1, write a function that returns true if "red" is in the list of strings. (Remember about .equals())

2. Using #3, write a function that returns true if a list of booleans contains any false booleans.
