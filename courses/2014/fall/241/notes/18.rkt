;; Chapter 13
;; - The code in this chapter is so painful.
;; - Read this blog post and the papers it links to at the top:
;;   http://matt.might.net/articles/red-black-delete/
;; - In our reading, we'll focus on the theorems

;; 13.1
;; - Can we really store one more bit per node?
;; - REALLY understand this proof

;; 13.1-1
;; - This is to practice your understanding of the RB props

;; 13.1-3
;; - Where does blackness enter the props?

;; 13.1-4
;; - Write out each example
;; - What does this tell you about what RB trees are doing?

;; 13.1-5
;; - Think about the RB props and make some examples
;; - Think about the shortest path then modify it into the longest
;;   by considering when you can "add" nodes

;; 13.1-6
;; - Think about the last problem

;; 13.1-7
;; - Think about the last problem :)

;; 13.-2---
;; - You should read and skim this, but don't bother full grokking the
;; code. I find it very confusing and the guarantees of RB trees is
;; more important than the implementation
;; - Mainly, look at the pictures and the prose that describes them
