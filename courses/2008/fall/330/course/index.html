<p>The fundamental tool of a computer scientist and software engineer
is the programming language. Programming languages of all shapes and
sizes are found under every rock in computing. There are large,
mainstream languages that everyone uses regularly. But, there are also
small, domain-specific languages that are like feudal lords:
well-known to their subjects, but anonymous in the wider world.</p>

<p>Few of us will design a large mainstream language during our
careers, but almost all of us will (need to) design and implement at
least one small language. Sometimes, this design might even be
implicit if we're not educated about what constitutes a language.</p>

<p>This course will prepare you to understand the design of all
languages and to design and implement small ones. In contrast to
other courses of this nature, we will not treat programming languages
like fish and try to make little boxes for them to fit in. Programming
languages are not fish. Instead, we will explore the "periodic table"
of languages features and concepts. In particular, this course
will <em>not</em> teach you to program in many languages. There is too
much noise in that approach that distracts from the <em>real</em>
differences.</p>

<h2>Textbook &amp; Readings</h2>

<p>Unless stated otherwise, readings are from the course text
(freely available
online), <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/">Programming
Languages: Application and Interpretation</a> (PLAI), by Shriram
Krishnamurthi.  We will
use <a href="http://www.drscheme.org/">DrScheme v4.1</a> for many
programming assignments. (Make sure you read the "Get the Software"
section on the text book site.) Other language implementations will be
provided when necessary. We will look
at <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/bigsurv.ps">Paul
Wilson's survey<a> of Garbage Collection methods later in the
course.</p>

<p>DrScheme v4.1 is available on the department machines in
the <code>/users/groups/cs330/plt</code>. Run
the <code>drscheme</code> binary in the <code>bin</code>
directory.</p>

<p><em>Note: We will not be using the textbook in the traditional
way. Think of the textbook as your lecture notes. Don't read it before
a class, but refer to it afterwards. The book is superb, so you won't
need to distract yourself from the discussion by taking copious
notes. (You may want to take note of your ideas and insights, but the
content of the lecture will be in the textbook.)</em></p>

<h2>Assignments</h2>

<p>All assignments are due by 2<small>AM</small> the day after the day
listed. Assignments that are a second late will not be
graded.</p>

</table>

<p>All assignments (with a few exceptions) are to be emailed
to <a href="mailto:jay@cs.byu.edu">jay@cs.byu.edu</a>. The subject
must be: "BYU - Fall 2008 - CS 330 - Section x - y", where 'x' is your
section (1 or 2) and 'y' is the name of the assignment above. Only one
email should be sent per team. If two are sent, I will grade
the <em>oldest</em> one. The message body should be the names of the
team members <em>one per line</em>. You should attach (or provide a
link to) an archive (<code>zip</code> or <code>tgz</code> is fine) of
your work. The archive should create a folder with the coded name of
the assignment. Even assignments with one file should create a
folder. Each assignment specifies the names of code files, if not,
use the coded name.</p>

<p>Written essays must be submitted as PDFs. Use this as an
opportunity to learn LaTeX. (Some written assignments carry files,
these should be in the folder.)</p>

<p>Assignments that do not have the correct format on either the
code, writing, or submission email will not be graded.</p>

<h2>Scheme Material</h2>
<p>If you need a Scheme reference, see Chapters 1-6
of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme.html">Teach
yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days</a>
or <a href="http://www.htdp.org">How to Design Programs</a> (the intro
text that goes with DrScheme).  We will use the following
constructs/concepts this term: functions, conditionals, symbols,
user-defined datatypes (using define-type, covered in class notes
only), lists (including map, filter, etc), functions as arguments,
let/local.</p>

<p>DrScheme comes with an extensive manual and guide. This is
available via the "Help > Help Desk" menu item. It is
also <a href="http://docs.plt-scheme.org/">online</a>. Use the search
box. Refer to
the <a href="http://docs.plt-scheme.org/quick/index.html">Tutorial</a>, <a href="http://docs.plt-scheme.org/guide/index.html">Guide</a>,
and <a href="http://docs.plt-scheme.org/reference/index.html">Reference</a>.</p>

<p>PLAI comes with a manual
also: <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1730/2008/Manual/manual/index.html">It
is available here</a>.</p>

<h2>Team Work</h2>
 <p>
Most assignments for this class will be done in teams (pairs, with a
single triple if enrollment is an odd number). Our assignments tend to
be short on code but long on thinking, so this will give you the
opportunity to fully discuss a solution with another person. You will
work with four different people over the course of the semester.
 </p>

 <p>
Programming in teams does not mean each person writes part of the code
and the team simply pastes together these contributions. <strong>Each
person is responsible</strong> for every line of code, documentation,
etc. turned in.  <strong>This responsibility extends over written
assignments as well.</strong> It includes getting or losing points for
quality, being able to explain the work, and <strong>also incurring
penalties in case of plagiarism or other violations</strong>.  That
said, we <strong>will</strong> sometimes ask you questions
individually and, if you are unable to answer them, we may give you
less credit than your teammates.  In short, working is teams is meant
to help you learn material better, not to enable you to do less work
than you would have if the assignment had to be done individually.
 </p>

 <p>
For team projects, <strong>you may not discuss the assignment with a
<em>student</em> not on your team</strong>.
 </p>
       
 <p>
We recommend that teams develop the software together using <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair-programming
techniques</a> (of the form preached by <a
href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a>),
though this is a suggestion, not a requirement.  Pair-programming in a
nutshell:
       
 <ul>
<li>Both programmers share a single computer, monitor, and keyboard.</li>

<li>One person is the typist, the other watches what is being typed
and critiques it.</li>

<li>Programmers switch roles at regular intervals. (Note that this is
also good for preventing RSI!)</li>

<li>Both programmers jointly own every single line of code, regardless
of who typed it.</li>
 </ul>

While this does require that you schedule times to work with your
team, we think that pair-programming will increase your productivity
and aid you in taking responsibility for all of your code.
 </p>

 <p>
Assignments are broken into groups---approximately three assignments
per group. <strong>You will work with the same team for every
assignment in a single group, and you may not work with anyone you
worked with in a previous group.</strong> Once you have selected a
partner please inform the course staff. If you are having difficulty
finding someone to be your partner, please contact us and we will
attempt to match you with another student.
 </p>

<h2>Coding Style</h2>

 <p><strong>20% of your grade for programming assignments will depend
on your design, style, and comments.</strong> Since we expect that you
document and test your code anyway, we think of this as giving you a
free 20% for each assignment.</p>

 <p>Not already knowing Scheme or having learned Scheme with a
different style are not excuses for not following these
requirements. We are using
the <a href="http://www.htdp.org/2001-01-18/Book/node14.htm">coding
style from How To Design Programs</a> for this course.</p>

 <ul>
   <li>All functions must have a <strong>purpose statement</strong>
that fully explains, in a sentence or two, what the function
does.</li>

   <li>All functions must have contracts.</li>

   <li>If you need to use a new type, define a new datatype to
represent it. Do not overload lists. <strong>Understand the difference
between lists and datatypes.</strong> Lists are homogeneous collections
of unlimited extent. In contrast, datatypes are heterogeneous
collections with a fixed number of members.</li>

   <li>As a general rule, all functions should be <strong>no longer
than what fits on a screen</strong>. We will of course relax this for
functions with a lot of pattern matching (<code>parse</code> comes to
mind) and in that case recommend that each match case fits on a
screen.</li>

   <li>Assume that your reader understands Scheme, so, in any inline
comments, explain <em>why</em> you wrote the code, don&#8217;t explain
<em>what</em> you wrote. We consider <code>define-type</code> to be
self-documenting.</li>

   <li>Only use Scheme primitives that we have taught in this
course. For example, use <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code>
instead of
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>. Likewise, consider using
<code><a
href="http://www.htdp.org/2001-01-18/Book/node99.htm">local</a></code>
instead of <code>let</code> (<code>local</code> is much better,
anyway).</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Testing: General Principles</h2>

 <p>All functions must have tests that exercise non-trivial cases. We
require this to encourage good software development skills, but, more
importantly, to force you to show us that you know what your code is
supposed to do and that you&#8217;re not getting a correct answer by
guessing. <strong>We will not give full credit to untested
functionality, even if it is correct!</strong></p>

<p>Good testing:</p>

 <ul>
   <li>Strikes a good balance between testing individual features and
testing the program as a whole.</li>

   <li>Actually <em>tests</em> the program.  That means not only
executing the program but also checking the output to ensure it is
what you expected.</li>

   <li>Includes comments to explain the purpose of each test.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Codewalks</h2>

  <p>We will use <em>codewalks</em>, a common practice at software
companies, to evaluate some of your programs. A codewalk is a
presentation where you, the programmer, convince us, a jury, of
specific properties of your program. You accomplish this by
<strong>presenting your program and answering questions about
it</strong>. We are most interested in</p>

  <ul>
    <li>correctness: does it do the right thing?,</li>
    <li>extensibility: how adaptable is it to related tasks?,</li>
    <li>robustness: is it built like a house of cards?, and</li>
    <li>performance: does it avoid poor implementation decisions?.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each program will receive about 30 minutes of scrutiny. The code
you present <strong>must the be the same</strong> code you turned in
electronically. We will not tell you if we will conduct a codewalk for
an assignment until <em>after</em> you have turned in a solutions for
it. No excuses or exceptions; you read it here.</p>
