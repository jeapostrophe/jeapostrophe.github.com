<em>You must do this assignment solo.  We know that some of you are
not yet comfortable with Scheme; for that reason, we will weight this
assignment very, very low in the overall score.  Doing poorly on it
will not at all damage your course grade.  But, you should exploit
this opportunity to become familiar with the style of programming you
will do in the rest of the semester.</em></p>


<h2>Extended Interpreter</h2>

<!--<p>Like the first assignment, this is to be completed solo.</p>
-->

<ol>

<li>Write a parser and interpreter for the CFWAE language we&#8217;ve
discussed in class, extended with the language features described
below.  Your interpreter should have eager application semantics and
use deferred substitution.  Call the new language CFWAE (conditionals,
functions, with, and arithmetic expressions).  </li> <br>

<li>After completing the first part of the assignment, copy the resulting
interpreter and modify it so that it has lazy application semantics. (We
strongly recommend that you not attempt this part of the assignment until
you&#8217;ve gotten the first interpreter done, thoroughly tested, and
debugged!)  <i>Ensure you don&apos;t miss the change you must make to the <a href="#lazyvalue">type definitions</a> for this part.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>In each part of the assignment, implement the function <code>parse</code>,
which consumes an expression in the language&#8217;s concrete syntax and returns
the abstract syntax representation of that expression. <code>parse</code> must
accept only expressions in the <a href="#grammar">grammar</a> of the language.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>parse</code>, you must implement the function
<code>interp</code>, which consumes an abstract syntax expression (as
returned by the <code>parse</code> function) and returns a
<code>CFWAE-value</code>. Please include a contract for every function that you
write and include test cases that amply exercise all of the code you&#8217;ve
written. </p>


<h4>Features to Implement</h4>


<dl>

<dt>Conditionals</dt>

<dd>
<p>To save the trouble of having to add boolean values and operators over them,
create the construct <code>if0</code> using the syntax described by the EBNF below.
Note that <code>if0</code> has three branches:</p>

<ul>
<li>A test expression</li>

<li>A &#8220;then&#8221; expression, which evaluates if the test expression
evaluates to zero</li>

<li>An &#8220;else&#8221; expression, which evaluates for any other number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Evaluation should signal an error for non-numeric test values.</p></dd>


<!--
<dt>Multi-armed <code>rec</code></dt>

<dd>
Using the datatype definition of environments, implement a multi-armed
<code>rec</code> construct that cyclically binds zero or more identifiers. If
there are multiple bindings of the same identifier in a single <code>rec</code>
expression&#8217;s list of bindings, your interpreter should halt with an error
message. Each named expression can access all the identifiers bound by the
<code>rec</code>. All the named expressions must syntactically be functions.
</dd>
-->

<dt>Multi-argument <code>fun</code></dt>

<dd><p>Extend the <code>fun</code> language feature described in lecture so
that functions can accept a list of zero or more arguments instead of
just one.  All arguments to the function must evaluate with the 
<i>same deferred substitutions</i>.  An example of a multi-argument fun:</p>

<pre>
{{fun {x y} {* x y}} 2 3}
</pre>

<p>This evaluates to 6.</p>

<p>As you did for multi-armed <code>with</code>, you must ensure that the
arguments to a function have distinct names.</p>



</dd>

</dl>

<a name="grammar" />
<h4>Syntax of CFWAE</h4>

<p>
The syntax of the CFWAE language with these additional
features can be captured with the following EBNF:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;CFWAE&gt; ::= &lt;num&gt;
    | {+ &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {- &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {* &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {/ &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | &lt;id&gt;
    | {if0 &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {with {{&lt;id&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;} ...} &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {fun {&lt;id&gt; ...} &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {&lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt; ...}
where an id is not +, -, *, /, with, if0 or fun.
</pre>


<p>In this grammar, the ellipsis (<code>...</code>) means that the previous
non-terminal is present zero or more times.</p>

<p>If a <code>fun</code> or a <code>with</code> expression has duplicate
identifiers, we consider it a syntax error. Therefore, such errors must be
detected in <code>parse</code>. For example, parsing the following
expressions must signal errors:

<pre>
{with {{x 10} {x 20}} 50}

{fun {x x} 10}
</pre>

<h4>Testing Your Code</h4>

<p><strong>You must include a contract for every function that you write and
include test cases that amply exercise all of the code you&#8217;ve
written.</strong> We will not give full credit to untested functionality, even
if it is correct!</p>

<p>Your parser and interpreter must detect errors and explicitly signal them by
calling <code>(error ...)</code>.  We will consider an error raised internally
by Scheme to be a bug in your code.</p>

<p>For example, Scheme signals a &quot;divide by zero&quot; error if you
attempt to evaluate <code>(/ 1 0)</code>.  Since we use Scheme&apos;s division
function to implement division in CFWAE, you may be tempted to leave it to
Scheme to signal division by zero errors for you.  However, you must signal the
error yourself by explicitly testing for division by zero before calling
Scheme&apos;s division procedure.</p>

If you are not sure if an error raised by your program constitutes a bug,
search the Help Desk for <code>test/exn</code>.  <code>test/exn</code> tests
for errors, but only succeeds on errors that you explicitly signal.

<h4>Support Code</h4>
<p>
Please once again use the "PLAI Scheme" language.  Your code 
<strong>must</strong> adhere to the following template, without any changes:
</p>

<pre>
(define-type Binding
  [binding (name symbol?) (named-expr CFWAE?)])

(define-type CFWAE
  [num (n number?)]
  [binop (op procedure?) (lhs CFWAE?) (rhs CFWAE?)]
  [with (lob (listof Binding?)) (body CFWAE?)]
  [id (name symbol?)]
  [if0 (c CFWAE?) (t CFWAE?) (e CFWAE?)]
  [fun (args (listof symbol?)) (body CFWAE?)]
  [app (f CFWAE?) (args (listof CFWAE?))])

(define-type Env
  [mtEnv]
  [anEnv (name symbol?) (value CFWAE-Value?) (env Env?)])

(define-type CFWAE-Value
  [numV (n number?)]
  [closureV (params (listof symbol?))
            (body CFWAE?)
            (env Env?)])

;; parse : expression -> CFWAE
;; This procedure parses an expression into a CFWAE
(define (parse sexp)
  ...)

;; interp : CFWAE Env -> CFWAE-Value
;; This procedure interprets the given CFWAE in the environment 
;; and produces a result in the form of a CFWAE-Value
;; (either a closureV or a numV)
(define (interp expr env)
  ...)
</pre>

<p><a name="lazyvalue">However</a>, for the second part of the assignment (lazy
application), you will need to add an <code>exprV</code> variant to
<code>CFWAE-Value</code>.  That is, <code>CFWAE-Value</code> for
<code>xinterp-lazy.ss</code> should read:</p>

<pre>
(define-type CFWAE-Value
  [numV (n number?)]
  [closureV (params (listof symbol?))
            (body CFWAE?)
            (env Env?)]
  [exprV (expr CFWAE?) (env Env?)]))
</pre>

<h4>Handin</h4>
<p>
You should turn in two Scheme programs where each contains all of the 
code needed to run your parser and interpreter.  One should be for the 
eager evaluation, called "xinterp.ss", and the other for the lazy evaluation, 
called "xinterp-lazy.ss".  You can also include a README or other relevant 
files.</p>
