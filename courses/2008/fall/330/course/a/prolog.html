<h3>Implementing Prolog</h3>

<p>In this assignment, you will implement Prolog-style logic variables
and backtracking search using Scheme's macros and continuations.  In
particular, you must implement the following:

<ul>
<li> <code> =succeed </code>: succeeds exactly once </li>

<li> <code> =fail </code>: does not succeed </li>

<li> <code> (== e1 e2) </code>: attempts to unify <code>e1</code>
with <code>e2</code> (succeeds at most once)

<li> <code> (=var (v ...) e) </code>: binds all of the <code>(v
...)</code> to fresh logic variables and evaluates <code>e</code> in the
extended environment </li>

<li> <code> (_) </code>: returns a fresh anonymous variable (its binding
always succeeds and affects nothing else)

<li> <code> (=or e ...) </code>: searches for variable assignments that
satisfy <b>any</b> of the <code>e ...</code> expressions

<li> <code> (=and e ...) </code>: searches for variable assignments that
satisfy <b>all</b> of the <code>e ...</code> expressions
</ul>


Some of these abstractions may be implementable as Scheme procedures,
while others will require the use of macros.  In either case, recall
the pattern we developed in class for performing backtracking: the
unification and search primitives (i.e. <code>=succeed</code>, 
<code>=fail</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>=or</code>, and
<code>=and</code>) consume a <b>failure continuation</b> (to be
invoked on failure) and, if successful, return a <b>success
continuation</b> (to allow resumption of the search).  This pattern
prevents the Prolog embedding from communicating ordinary program
answers through procedure return values.  Instead it uses logic
variables, which you will need to update imperatively, taking care to
restore when backtracking.

In addition to these linguistic extensions, you must also implement the
following testing interface:

<ul>
<li> <code> (=find-all (v ...) e) </code> : returns a list of all the
solutions to <code>e</code>; each solution is a list of variable
bindings (one binding for each of the <code>v ...</code>), and each
variable binding is a two-element list consisting of the quoted
variable name (a symbol) and its value.  Note that if the value is a 
list, it should be returned as a Scheme list.  The solutions should be
returned in their order of discovery (by a left-to-right depth-first
search), and each solution should list the variables in the order
provided.</li>

<li> <code> (=find-some n (v ...) e) </code> : returns a list of solutions
to <code>e</code>, as in <code>(findall ...)</code> from above, except
that search is bounded to at most <code>n</code> solutions (this allows us
to test on queries with infinite solutions)

</ul>

<p> Note that there is nothing special about the variables bound by 
<code>=find-all</code> and <code>=find-some</code>.  They are simply the 
logic variables whose values the user is interested in (v ...).

<h4>Data Types</h4>

There are two data types that you have to deal with in your 
unification process: flat types and cons types.  Flat types 
(e.g. numbers, symbols, strings) can be bound directly to logic variables.  
Cons types are compound objects that may have other data types or 
even logic variables within them.

You must implement <code>(=cons f r)</code> which produces a cons
of f and r.  Essentially, this behaves exactly like cons except that 
it stores the data in a representation you define to facilitate 
unification.  Here is a definition for <code>=list</code>:

<pre>
(define =list
  (lambda args
    (if (empty? args) '()
        (=cons (first args) (apply =list (rest args))))))
</pre>

Your definition of <code>=cons</code> should behave nicely with this. 
Thus,

<pre>
(show (x y) (== (=cons 1 (=cons (=cons 2 '()) '())) (=list x y)))
</pre>

should successfully find <code>x=1, y=(2)</code>.  Note here that 
<code>y</code>'s value is not implementation specific; it is a standard 
Scheme list.

<h4>Interactive Testing</h4>

These are not required by the assignment, but to aid in interactive 
testing (as shown in the examples below), you may find the following 
two definitions helpful:

<pre>
(define resumer-box (box 'resumer))

(define (next) ((unbox resumer-box) 'dummy))
(define-syntax show
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(show (vars ...) e)
     (=var (vars ...)
           (let/cc esc
             (let/cc fk
               (esc (let ([next (e fk)])
                      (set-box! resumer-box next)
                      (printf "~a: ~a~n" (quote vars) (lv-value vars))
                      ...
                      (void))))
             'fail))]))
</pre>

where <code>lv-value</code> accesses the value stored in the given 
logic variable.

<p>Please note that these definitions are <em>very</em> implementation 
specific.  If you would like to use them for testing, we not only encourage you, but we expect you to modify them to make them work with your implementation.

<h4>Testing</h4>

Please use the following definitions to help you with your testing:

<pre>
;; symbol -> boolean : returns true if and only if the given
;; symbol is an uninterned symbol
(define (gensym? s)
  (not (equal? (string->symbol (symbol->string s)) s)))

;; list X list -> boolean : takes two bindings (for example, returned
;; from =find-all) and returns true if and only if the two variables
;; they bind are equal to the same thing.
(define (binding-equal? b1 b2)
  (equal? (second b1) (second b2)))

;; Prolog-Expr X symbol X bool-Exprs ... -> Test result : Takes a 
;; (=find-all ...) or (=find-some ...), an identifier, and a set of 
;; expressions that evaluate to booleans when the identifier is bound 
;; to the result of the given Prolog-expr.  The test passes if and 
;; only if all of the boolean expressions are true.
(define-syntax test-prolog
  (syntax-rules (test-prolog)
    [(test-prolog find-expr result-id bool ...)
     (test (let ([result-id find-expr])
             (and bool ...)) true)]))
</pre>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Please do not use global variables for this assignment.  We expect your implementation 
to have the ability to do a query, capture the continuation returned, do a different 
query, and then invoke the first continuation with no trouble.

<li>Unbound variables should have a unique "value" in their output.  That is, if 
<code>y</code> is unbound, it should have a unique symbol as its value.  If 
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are dependently unbound, they should have 
the same unique symbol as their values.

<li>Remember that order counts.  Please carefully read the definitions for =find-all 
and =find-some.  Even if your results are correct, if they are in the wrong order 
or format, they will be marked as incorrect.

<li>Remember that <code>=cons</code> is a construct that you use to make lists 
with logic variables in them; it's not necessarily a list itself.  That's why 
if you are making 
a test which should bind the logic variable <code>X</code> to, say,
<code>(=cons 1 '())</code>, the test case should check that the result 
equals <code>(cons 1 '())</code> or <code>'(1)</code> rather than 
<code>(=cons 1 '())</code> to build 
the result.

<li>Remember to implement the occurs check during unification.
</ul>

<h4> Example 1: Simple Search </h4>

<p>
You might want to start by just testing <code>=and</code> and
<code>=or</code> with success and failure (no logic variables).  In
this restricted setting, there are a couple of useful properties:
namely, if <code>e1</code> succeeds in <i>n1</i> ways, <code>e2</code>
succeeds in <i>n2</i> ways, etc., then <code>(=or e1 e2 ...)</code>
succeeds in <i>n1 + n2 + ...</i> ways, and <code>(=and e1 e2
...)</code> succeeds in <i>n1 * n2 * ...</i> ways.  For instance,

<pre>
(=and (=or =succeed =succeed =fail =succeed)
      (=or =fail =succeed =succeed))
</pre>
succeeds in six ways.  The first <code>=or</code> succeeds in three
ways, the second <code>=or</code> succeeds in two ways, and the
<code>=and</code> combines them in all possible ways.

Likewise,

<pre>
(=or (=and =succeed =succeed)
     (=and =fail =succeed =succeed)
     (=and =succeed))
</pre>
succeeds in two ways.  The first and third <code>=and</code>s each
succeed in one way, and the <code>=or</code> explores both of
them.

<p>
You can use <code>show</code> (with an empty variable list) and
<code>next</code> to count how many times a query succeeds. You can 
also use the following test-prolog expression:

<pre>
(test-prolog (=find-all () (=or (=and =succeed =succeed)
                                (=and =fail =succeed =succeed)
                                (=and =succeed)))
             result
             (= (length result) 2))
</pre>
<br>

<h4> Example 2: Family Trees </h4>

<p>
As a more complicated example, suppose we have the following
definitions:

<pre>
(define (=parent c p)
  (=or (=and (== c 'vito) (== p 'dom))
       (=and (== c 'sonny) (== p 'vito))
       (=and (== c 'michael) (== p 'vito))
       (=and (== c 'fredo) (== p 'vito))
       (=and (== c 'sophia) (== p 'michael))
       (=and (== c 'tony) (== p 'michael))))

(define (=ancestor X Y)
  (=or (=parent X Y)
       (=var (Z)
             (=and (=parent X Z)
                   (=ancestor Z Y)))))
</pre>
Then we get the following query results:
<pre>
> (show (x) (=ancestor x 'vito))
x: sonny
> (next)
x: michael
> (next)
x: fredo
> (next)
x: sophia
> (next)
x: tony
> (next)
'fail
> (find-all (x) (=parent x 'michael))
(list (list (list 'x 'sophia))
      (list (list 'x 'tony)))
> (find-some 3 (x y) (=ancestor x y))
(list (list (list 'x 'vito) (list 'y 'dom))
      (list (list 'x 'sonny) (list 'y 'vito))
      (list (list 'x 'michael) (list 'y 'vito)))
</pre>
