<p><em>Form new groups of two for this assignment. We will not accept
this assignment from people working individually or with a partner
from the previous assignments. Email me the names of the members of
your group by 5 pm five days after the "out" date for this assignment
(only one member needs to send this email). If you cannot find a
partner, send us an email by the same deadline and you will be
assigned a partner. In order to avoid being assigned a random partner,
we suggest staying after class that day to find a partner in
person. Missing the email deadline will lower your grade for this
assignment by 10% per day late.</em></p>

<h4> Problem 1 </h4>

<p> <b> Submit your solution as whynostack.pdf</b> </p>

<p>Any program that consumes some amount of stack, when converted to CPS and
run, suddenly consumes no stack space at all.  Why?</p>


<hr />


<h4> Problem 2 </h4>

<p> <b> Submit your solution as filterk.ss </b> </p>

<p> CPS the following Scheme function.  You don&#8217;t need to CPS
primitives such as <code>empty?</code>, <code>first</code>,
<code>rest</code>, <code>cons</code>, <code>cons?</code> and
<code>&lt;</code>.  You may also assume that the function argument to both
of the functions is in CPS.  Name the result <code>filter/k</code> as shown
below.</p>

<pre>
;; filter: (x -> bool) (listof x) -> (listof x)
(define (filter f l)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) empty]
    [else (cond
            [(f (first l)) (cons (first l)
                                 (filter f (rest l)))]
            [else (filter f (rest l))])]))

;; filter/k: (x receiver -> doesn't return) (listof x) receiver -> doesn't return
(define (filter/k f l k)
  'fill-me-in)
</pre>

<p> Now change the following expressions to use <code>filter/k</code>. </p>

<pre>
(define (less-than-three x)
   (< x 3))
(filter less-than-three
        (cons 1 (cons 4 empty))) ;; this evaluates to (list 1)

</pre> <br>


<hr />

<h4> Problem 3 </h4>

<p> <b> Submit your solution as stackinspect.ss </b> </p>

<p>The Java security model uses a primitive called <em>stack
inspection</em>.  Let us implement a simple version of this.  Assume
the language had two new primitives:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;E&gt; ::= ...
    | {bless &lt;E&gt;}
    | {check}
</pre>

<p>The <code>bless</code> primitive creates a blessed stack frame for
the duration of evaluating its sub-expression.  The <code>check</code>
primitive traverses the run-time stack; if it finds a blessed frame it
evaluates to <code>0</code> (so you can, for instance, use it inside
sums without affecting the outcome), otherwise it terminates the
program's execution.
</p>

<p>
Extend the CPSed interpreter presented in the text in Figure 20.2
with these two new language constructs.  For your convenience, here is a file
to start with: <a href="../templates/stackinspect.ss">stackinspect.ss</a>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: Java lacks tail-call optimization ostensibly
because this hurts the ability to implement stack inspection.  In
fact, <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/cf-toplas04.pdf">this 
claim is entirely false</a>.  But we're stuck with the result of this
decision, making the JVM a poor target for other language compilers.
Unfortunately, .NET has also adopted this mistake, as the paper explains.
