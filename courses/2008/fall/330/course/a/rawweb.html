<p><em>You must complete this program with the same partner you had for
&quot;Laziness&quot;.  This will be your team for the next few assignments.</em></p>

<h2>Raw Web Programming</h2>

<p>This assignment asks you to write a web program. At this point in the
course, the purpose of this assignment seems unclear. Once the assignment has
been handed in, however, we&#8217;ll introduce an entirely new way of
programming the web which is intimately linked with one of the fundamental ideas
of programming languages. By completing this assignment now, you&#8217;ll be
better prepared to appreciate this idea when we introduce it in class. </p>

<p>Though this assignment should not take you very long, we are giving you a
lot of time because we know that not everyone is familiar with
web programming; you may need to do some learning on your own.  Furthermore, to
avoid last-minute problems, this project has an early &#8220;Hello,
World!&#8221; hand-in in which you must demonstrate you have a web
programming environment set up.</p>



<h3>Choose Your Language</h3>

<p>Unlike the other programming assignments in the course, in this one you will
be able to use <strong>a programming language of your choice</strong>. If
you&#8217;re already familiar with web programming, choose a language that
you&#8217;re comfortable with. If you&#8217;re not, the web is a font of
meta-information, so you should have little trouble in finding resources about
programming for it.</p>

<p>For example, your web program may run as:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>A CGI script.</strong> CGI stands for &#8220;Common
Gateway Interface&#8221; and is the simplest web-programming
protocol. We recommend using CGI if you have never programmed a web
application
before. <a href="http://docs.cs.byu.edu/olddocproj/docs/web-setup/">See
this page for help.</a></li>

<li><strong>A Java servlet.</strong> If you have used Java servlets
before, you may use them for this assignment.
<strong>You will be responsible for starting and maintaining a Tomcat server
instance</strong> for your servlet. Both traditional servlets and JSPs are
acceptable.</li>

<li><strong>A PHP script.</strong> Finally, you may use PHP.</li>

</ul>

<h3>&#8220;Hello, World!&#8221;</h3>

<p>We&#8217;re want you to get your web programming setup sorted out early.
You must demonstrate that you have by creating a &#8220;hello, world!&#8221;
web application. The application should show a web page with the text
&#8220;hello, world!&#8221; and the current time and date.</p>

<p>We won&#8217;t require a formal handin for
this. Instead, <strong>e-mail the me with the URL of your application
and what language/environment you&#8217;re using</strong>. We must
receive this e-mail by 2<small>AM</small> on the day after the due
date.</p>


<h3>Program Requirements</h3>

<p>You will write the authoring half of a simple blogging tool.  (The
publishing half that would complete the tool is outside the scope of this
assignment.) Although this program is quite simple, it is representative of the
core of much larger Web software (just as the interpreters we write in this
course are themselves quite lean, but represent the core of large programming
languages).</p>

<p>Weblogs (&#8220;blogs&#8221;) are web pages that consist of a list of posts
ordered so that newer content is at the top. For our purposes, a post
is a title, somebody text, and a post date.  You must assume that the
title and body are plain, ASCII-encoded text.  In particular, this means that
your software will need to escape HTML entities.  For example, typing
&#8220;&lt;b&gt;&#8221; into a text field should not make any part of the post
bold.</p>

<p>The main page of your web application should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of posts, sorted correctly by date.</li>
<li>A form for creating new posts, with a field for the title and a text area
for the body.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon submitting the form, the user should see a preview page that shows the
post along with its date. <strong>The post is not shown on the main page until
the user confirms it from the preview page</strong>, either through a link or a
form button.</p>

<p>We do not require that you save posts to disk, but you may need to, depending
on your choice of web application environment. We require that your web
application pass this persistence test: <strong>a post added from one computer
should be visible from the main page on an entirely different computer</strong>,
if the web server has not been restarted. You do not need to worry about
concurrent accesses (i.e. you need not lock any data files).</p>
