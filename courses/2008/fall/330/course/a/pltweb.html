entire program but you only need one hand in.</em></p>

<h2>Web Programming in Scheme</h2>

<h3>Assignment Task</h3>

<p>Repeat the <a href="rawweb.html">Raw Web Programming assignment</a> using the
PLT Scheme Web Server.  Instructions for using the PLT Web Server
follow.</p>

<p>Include a readme file in your submission. In it, list the names of the people
in your group. Additionally, contrast 3-5 language features that you used in
this assignment to the language features encountered in the Raw Web assignments.
Even if the members of your group used different languages in the Raw Web
assignment, all of you are still responsible for understanding the presented
response. The analysis should be 2 paragraphs or fewer. Grammar and word choice
matter.</p>

<h3>Writing Servlets</h3>

<p>You may write your servlets in DrScheme and save them anywhere. If
you use this template for your servlets:</p>

<pre>
#lang plai/web

(define (start initial-request)
  ; initial page goes here
  ...)
</pre>

<p>Then you can run the servlet with the server by pressing "Run".</p>

<h3>Quasi-Quoting</h3>

<p>You may notice sample servlets quoting lists with <code>`</code> instead of
<code>'</code>. This is called quasiquoting, as opposed to quoting.
Quasiquoting lets you evaluate specific elements of a quasiquoted expression
instead of directly returning the expression. To force evaluation of an element
in a quasiquoted expression, prefix the element with a comma. For example, to
generate the list <code>'(1 2 3 4)</code> you may write <code>`(1 2 ,(+ 0 3)
4)</code>. Quasiquoting is a convenient way to insert dynamic elements into
HTML templates.  If you want more information or examples, the <a
href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.2.6">Scheme
standard</a> is a good place to look.</p>
