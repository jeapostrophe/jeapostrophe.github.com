<h2>Musical Notation (Written)</h2>

<p>In 850 words, or less, explain how musical notation is like a
programming language.</p>

<p>I will grade this assignment to reward creativity. Each possible
comparison between music and a PL is worth 1 point for the whole
class. That point is divided by the number of people who write about
the comparison. For example, suppose four people said, "Music is like
a PL because of X", then each would get a 1/4 point. If only one
person said it, then he or she would get the point. Etc.</p>
