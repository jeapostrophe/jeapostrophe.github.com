<p><em>You must complete this program with the same partner you had for
&quot;Continuations (Written)&quot;.  This will be your team for the next few assignments.</em></p>

<h3>Garbage Collection</h3>

<p>In this assignment, you will implement two garbage collectors:
<strong>mark &amp; sweep</strong>, and <strong>stop &amp;
copy</strong>. As we have seen, garbage collection involves starting
from a <em>root set</em> of references, which reside in local
variables and stack frames, and searching for reachable values on the
heap.</p>

<h3>Writing your Garbage Collectors</h3>

<p>Your garbage collectors must be written in the <i>GC Collector Scheme</i>
language level.  This language defines an interface to a program&apos;s stack
and heap that you will use to implement garbage collection.</p>

<p>Your garbage collectors must implement the following functions:</p>

<ul>

<li><code>init-allocator :: -> void</code> The mutator implicitly calls this
function after initializing the heap and before calling any allocation
routines.  It is essentially a callback into the allocator indicating that the
heap is ready.</li>

<li><code>gc:cons :: first-addr rest-addr -> cons-addr</code> returns the
address of a new cons cell with the given field addresses; the field addresses
are presumed to be already allocated</li>

<li><code>gc:cons? :: addr -> boolean</code> returns a boolean that indicates
whether the given address refers to a cons cell</li>

<li><code>gc:first :: cons-addr -> first-addr</code> and <code> gc:rest ::
cons-addr -> rest-addr</code> return the fields of a given cons</li>

<li><code>gc:set-first! :: cons-addr first-addr  -> void</code> and
<code>gc:set-rest! :: cons-addr rest-addr  -> void</code> set the addresses of the first and last pointers of a cons cell</li>

<li><code>gc:alloc-flat :: atomic -> number</code> allocates space for a flat value and returns the base address of the allocated block</li>

<li><code>gc:flat? :: addr -> boolean</code>
returns a boolean that indicates whether the given address refers to
an atomic value</li>

<li><code>gc:deref :: addr -> atomic</code> returns the atomic value stored at
the given address</li>

</ul>

<p>To help you write these functions, the <i>GC Collector Scheme</i> language defines an interface for the heap and the roots:</p>

<ul>

<li><code>heap-size :: -> number</code> the size of the heap</li>

<li><code>heap-set! :: addr atomic -> void</code> stores a value at the specified address</li>

<li><code>heap-ref :: addr -> atomic</code> returns the value at the specified address</li>

<li><code>get-root-set :: -> listof root</code> returns the roots of the collection</li>

<li><code>read-root :: root -> addr</code> returns the address the root
references</li>

<li><code>set-root! :: root addr -> void</code> updates the root to reference the specified address</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that <code>get-root-set</code> accepts an arbitrary number of
identifiers that it treats as roots and returns as part of the root set.  That
is, <code>read-root</code> returns the cell address stored in the location
referenced by the identifiers and <code>set-root!</code> mutates the identifier
to reference a new cell address.  You may find this useful when you implement
<code>gc:cons</code>; you may wish to add the <code>first</code> and
<code>last</code> arguments to your root set in lieu of manually updating them if they move during garbage collection.</p>
 
<h3>Testing your Garbage Collectors</h3>

<p>You may write programs that exercise your garbage collectors using the <i>GC
Mutator Scheme</i> language.  This language is a subset of Scheme that uses a
garbage collector that you specify.  The first line of a test program must
be:</p>

<pre>(allocator-setup "collector.ss" heap-size)</pre>

<p><code>"collector.ss"</code> must be the name of your collector&apos;s file.  <code>heap-size</code> is the size of the heap your collector will use.</p>

<p>The remainder of the program is in a subset of Scheme with numbers, symbols,
lists, etc.  The primitives of the language map directly to the procedures you
define in your garbage collector.</p>

<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<p>To get you started, we&apos;ve provided a <a
href="../templates/mutator.ss">sample mutator</a> and a <a
href="../templates/collector.ss">trivial collector</a> that signals an error
when the heap fills up.  (In fact, our collector does signal an error with the
mutator we&apos;ve provided, if you don&apos;t increase the size of the
heap.)</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>You must store bookkeeping data on the heap provided by <i>GC Collector
Scheme</i>.  You may store 2-3 atomic values, such as addresses into the heap
as variables in your garbage collector.  We will assume they represent machine
registers.  However, all compound data structures must be on the heap.</p>


<p>In particular, in the mark &amp; sweep collector, you should maintain a free
list <strong>in the heap</strong>.  That is, you should not use any auxiliary
data structure; instead, use the available space in the heap to keep track of
the free list. You may use one extra box (&#8220;register&#8221;) to point to
the start of the free list.  You may need to adjust your allocation accordingly
to have enough space to maintain free list pointers! </p>

<p>Some final words of advice:</p>

<ul>

<li> You will want to test your program with small heap sizes, so that
the garbage collector runs frequently.  </li>

<li>You do not need to compact memory in mark-and-sweep.</li>

<li> You may find it convenient to use the Scheme construct
<tt>set!</tt>, which allows you to mutate a variable without using
boxes.  We recommend you use this feature only in one instance: when
swapping the semispaces in the stop &amp; copy collector.  This will
save you the trouble of unboxing the heap every time you use it.  </li>

</ul>
