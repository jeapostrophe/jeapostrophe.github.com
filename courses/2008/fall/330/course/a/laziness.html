<p><em>Complete this assignment with the same team you worked with for Substitution (Written).  You and your partner should each understand the 
answers to all the problems, so don't just split up the work.</em></p>

<h2>Laziness</h2>

<p>For this assignment, we will use the <a
href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> programming language.  The
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a>
(GHC) is freely available for most platforms and is installed on the
CS department network.  To start the interactive evaluator, simply run
<b>ghci</b>.</p>

<p>Haskell has wonderful standard libraries which probably contain the function
you're looking for.  To see tree-style browsable docs, check out the
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/"> Haskell
Hierarchical Libraries </a>.  You should particularly take advantage of
the 
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Prelude.html">
<code>Prelude</code></a>, which is the set of functions that are "built in"
to Haskell.  You're welcome to use other functions; if you want to do so, you
must put an <code>import</code> statement at the top of your code (there's
an example in the template).</p>

<p>The following are library functions that you may find particularly helpful,
and which are all in the Haskell <code>Prelude</code>:</p>

<table>
<tr align="center"><th>Haskell Function</th><th>Scheme
Analog</th></tr> <tr align="center"><td>==</td><td>eq?</td></tr> <tr
align="center"><td>&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=</td><td>&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=,
&gt;=</td></tr> <tr align="center"><td>mod</td><td>modulo</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>div</td><td>quotient</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>not</td><td>not</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>!!</td><td>list-ref</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>filter</td><td>filter</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>all</td><td>andmap</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>any</td><td>ormap</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>take</td><td>(returns a prefix of a list)</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>takeWhile</td><td>(returns the prefix of a list
satisfying a predicate)</td></tr>
</table>
<br>

Any function whose name begins with a symbolic character is an infix
operator.  Other binary functions can be used as infix operators by
enclosing in backquotes (e.g., <code>x `mod` y</code>).  Also, infix
operators can be used as ordinary functions by enclosing them in
parentheses (e.g., <code>(!!) [1, 2, 3] 2</code>).
<br><br>
Please submit a README file explaining how you tested your code. Actual test 
cases are preferable, but a clear summary of what you did will be sufficient as
long as your code actually works as you claim it does.

<h3> Problem 1: Prime Numbers </h3>

<ol>

<!-- Read over the given definition of <code>factors :: Integer ->
[Integer]</code>, which computes the prime factorization of any given
natural number.

<br><br>-->

<li> Write <code>isPrime :: Integer -> Bool</code>, which
determines whether a given integer is prime. </li>

<li> Define <code>primes :: [Integer]</code>, the list of all
primes. </li>

<li> Revise <code>isPrime</code> so that it only tests divisibility by
<i>prime</i> factors.  Just turn in the revised version.</li>

<!--<li> How many primes are computed to determine the primality of
1000000000039? </li> -->

</ol>

<hr>

<h3> Problem 2: Longest Common Subsequence </h3>

<ol>

<li> Write <code> buildList :: Int -> (Int -> a) ->
   [a]</code>, where <code>((buildList n f) !! i) == (f i)</code>
(for all i in [0 .. n-1]). </li>

<li> Write <code> buildTable :: Int -> Int -> (Int -> Int -> a) ->
   [[a]]</code>, where <code>(((buildTable n m f) !! i) !! j) == (f i
   j)</code> (for all i in [0 .. n-1], j in [0 .. m-1]). </li>

<li> Write <code> lcsLength :: String -> String -> Int</code>, 
which quickly
computes the length of the longest common subsequence of two strings s1 and s2.
Hint: you can easily compute <code>lcsLength (take i s1) (take j s2)</code>
from

<pre>
lcsLength (take (i-1) s1) (take   j   s2),
lcsLength (take   i   s1) (take (j-1) s2), and 
lcsLength (take (i-1) s1) (take (j-1) s2).
</pre></li>

and the knowledge of whether <code>(s1 !! i) == (s2 !! j)</code>.  Note that you will lose credit if you use a slow, "brute force" method; make use of your table!

</ol>

<h3> Problem 3: Minimax Search </h3>

In this exercise, you will implement a strategy to play a simple game.
The game is called Mancala, but you won't need to worry about the
specific rules, since we have implemented that part for you.  Your job
is to build a tree of possible move sequences and choose the move that
appears best.

<br>

The support code below provides the following set of data types and functions:

<ul>

<li> <code>Player</code>: values of this type represent the players
of the game (<code>PlayerA</code> or <code>PlayerB</code>).</li>

<li> <code>State</code>: values of this type represent game
configurations.</li>

<li> <code>initialState :: Player -> State</code> represents the
initial configuration of the game board (the given player goes
first).</li>

<li> <code>getPlayer: State -> Player</code>: given a configuration,
returns the player who makes the next move.</li>

<li> <code>gameValue :: State -> Int</code> returns Player A's score
minus Player B's score.  (Player A wants a big value and Player B 
wants a small value.)</li>

<li> <code>nextStates :: State -> [State]</code> gives the possible
configurations after the next move.  If the returned list is empty, then
the game is over.</li>

<li> <code>simulateGame :: IO</code> uses an IO loop to allow you to play 
Mancala.  The valid moves are the numbers 1 through 6 and they indicate 
the player playing the nth cup on her side.  Player A goes first; her cups 
are on the top row and are numbered from right to left.  Player B is the 
bottom row numbered from left to right.</li>

<li> <code> simulateAIGame :: (State -> Int) -> IO</code> consumes a 
scoring function and plays 
the game where Player A is the AI using that function.  We give you 
the helper function, <code>level :: Int -> IO</code> in the stub file, 
which consumes a difficulty and runs simulateAIGame using your 
functions.  This may be helpful for testing.</li>

</ul>

<ol>

<li> Define a datatype <code>GameTree</code> to represent the game
state after any sequence of moves.  Each node should have its current
configuration and a list of trees, where each tree corresponds to
the game states obtainable after making any one legal 
move.</li>

<li> Define <code>mkTree :: State -> GameTree</code>, which consumes 
a state and returns the tree of all legal board configurations (those
obtainable by repeated application of <code>nextStates</code> to the
given state).  Use this to define <code>mancala :: GameTree</code>, the 
entire game of Mancala as a GameTree (remember that Player A goes 
first).</li>

<li> Define <code>prune :: Int -&gt; GameTree -&gt; GameTree</code>, which
prunes a tree to a given depth. </li>

<li> Define <code>minimax :: GameTree -&gt; Int</code>,
which consumes a (pruned) tree and evaluates the configuration by
looking ahead and applying the minimax algorithm.  If a node has no
children, its value is the <code>gameValue</code> of its <code>State</code>. 
Remember, Player A, 
Maxi, is always trying to get the maximum value, and Player B, Mini, 
is always trying to get the minimum value.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Support Code</h4>
<p> Note that you must download both files (even for problems 1 and 2), and
you must put them both in the same directory.  To test your code interactively,
first <code>cd</code> into the directory with your code, and then do
<code>ghci Laziness.hs</code> at which point you should either see a parse
error, type error, or this:
