<em>You must do this assignment solo.  We know that some of you are
not yet comfortable with Scheme; for that reason, we will weight this
assignment very, very low in the overall score.  Doing poorly on it
will not at all damage your course grade.  But, you should exploit
this opportunity to become familiar with the style of programming you
will do in the rest of the semester.</em></p>


<h2>Rudimentary Interpreter</h2>

<p> Write a parser and interpreter for the WAE language 
([<a href="#one">1</a>])
we discussed
in class. <strong>The textbook can be of great assistance in this
part of the assignment;</strong> they provide the beginnings of a
parser, an abstract syntax datatype and an interpreter.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve <strong>written and tested</strong> the parser and
interpreter for WAE, extend the language with these features:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Binary arithmetic operators</dt>

<dd><p>In place of having separate rules for <code>+</code> and
<code>-</code>, define a single syntactic rule for all binary arithmetic
operators.  Parse these into a <code>binop</code> datatype variant.
Define a table that maps operator names (symbols) to actual functions
(Scheme procedures) that perform the corresponding operation.  Having a
single rule like this, accompanied by a table, makes your language
easier to extend: once you have modified your parser and interpreter
once to support binary operators, you won't need to touch either one to
add any number of new ones.  To demonstrate this, define multiplication
and division (using <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> to represent them
in the language's concrete syntax).  </p></dd>

<dt>Multi-armed <code>with</code> </dt>

<dd><p>Each identifier bound by
the <code>with</code> expression is bound only in its body.  There will
be zero or more identifiers bound by each <code>with</code> expression.
If there are multiple bindings of the same identifier in a single
<code>with</code> expression&#8217;s bindings list, your interpreter should 
halt with an error message.  An example:</p>

<pre>
{with {{x 2}
       {y 3}}
  {with {{z {+ x y}}}
    {+ x z}}}
</pre>

<p>will evaluate to <code>7</code>, while</p>

<pre>
{with {{x 2}
       {x 3}}
	{+ x 2}}
</pre>

<p>will halt with an error message.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The syntax of the WAE language with these additional features can
be captured using EBNF notation ([<a href="#two">2</a>]):</p>

<pre>
&lt;WAE&gt; ::= &lt;num&gt;
    | {+ &lt;WAE&gt; &lt;WAE&gt;}
    | {- &lt;WAE&gt; &lt;WAE&gt;}
    | {* &lt;WAE&gt; &lt;WAE&gt;}
    | {/ &lt;WAE&gt; &lt;WAE&gt;}
    | {with {{&lt;id&gt; &lt;WAE&gt;}*} &lt;WAE&gt;}
    | &lt;id&gt;
where an &lt;id&gt; is not +, -, *, /, or with.
</pre>


<p> You should turn in a single Scheme program containing all of the code needed
to run your parser and interpreter. <strong>Implement the function
<code>parse</code></strong>, which consumes an expression in the language's
concrete syntax and returns the abstract syntax representation of that
expression. Also <strong>implement the function <code>calc</code></strong>,
which consumes an abstract syntax expression (as returned by the
<code>parse</code> function) and returns a Scheme number. </p>

<p><strong>You must include a contract for every function that you write and
include test cases that amply exercise all of the code you&#8217;ve
written.</strong> We will not give full credit to untested functionality, even
if it is correct!</p>

<a name="one" />

<p> [1] Remember, the WAE language has numbers, two arithmetic operators
(<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>), identifiers and <code>with</code> expressions.
Of course, to handle identifiers and <code>with</code> expressions you'll have
to implement substitution. (You do not have to implement caching substitution,
but you are free to do so.) Finally, both the concrete syntax and abstract
syntax are specified by the WAE language&#8217;s BNF (which can be found in the
textbook). </p>

<a name="two" />

<p> [2] The textbook introduced you to BNF.  An
extension of this notation, called EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form),
provides three additional operators:</p>

<ul>
<li> <code>?</code> means that one or more symbols to its left can
appear zero or one times. </li>

<li> <code>*</code> means that one or more symbols to its left can be
repeated zero or more times. </li>

<li> <code>+</code> means that one or more symbols to its left can
appear one or more times. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support Code</h4>

<p>
Your code <strong>must</strong> adhere to the following templates,
without any changes:
</p>

<pre>
(define-type Binding
  [binding (name symbol?) (named-expr WAE?)])

(define-type WAE
  [num (n number?)]
  [binop (op procedure?) (lhs WAE?) (rhs WAE?)]
  [with (lob (listof Binding?)) (body WAE?)]
  [id (name symbol?)])

;; parse : s-exp -> WAE
;; Consumes an s-expression and generates the corresponding WAE
(define (parse sexp)
  (...))

;; calc : WAE -> number
;; Consumes a WAE representation of an expression and computes
;;   the corresponding numerical result
(define (calc expr)
  (...))
</pre>
