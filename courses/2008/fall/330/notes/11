* Three assignments out:
** Written Lazy
** Language design
** Raw Web Programming

* Replace environments with procedures
* Change numbers? We could, but who cares?
* Replace functions (closures) with functions (lambda)

* Syntactic interpreter
** Like our previous ones
* Meta interpreter
** Like this, uses features of language to implement similar features
** Can be very hard if there is a mismatch in semantics of similar features
** For example, laziness
* Meta-circular interpreter
** Meta interpreter for the language itself
** Don't help understanding
** Show linguistic power

* Recursive environments w/ recursion
