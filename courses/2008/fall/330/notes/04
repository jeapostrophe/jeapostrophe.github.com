* Remind about colloquium on Thursday
* Review
** Write WAE BNF / define-type
* Functions
** With is like function definition then application
** First model of functions is like DrScheme
*** Separate Definitions and Interactions windows
*** Passed in a set of definitions
** F1WAE --- {<id> <F1WAE>} for fun-app
*** Write new BNF / define-type
*** Write define-type for FunDef
**** Write double
*** Write interp (new arg: list of fundefs)
** Why are arguments F1WAEs?
** Why are function bodies F1WAEs?
** Namespaces
*** F1WAE functions are separate from named identifiers
*** Like Common Lisp, but not like Scheme
** Where are function definitions available?
*** This means funs can call each other
*** And themselves! No if means no bottom out of recursion
