* We have mutable data structure, but not 'variables'
** Like o.f = e
* How do we add 'set'?
** Just use env-lookup, but not store-lookup (l-value)
** Compare to C:
 x = 2
 y = x

* Interaction with function application?
** Write swap or use set on fun argument
* We have call-by-value, what about call-by-reference?
** Add refun... must have new value and new app code

* Are they good?
** In C, you can hide call-by-ref from caller
** In modern languages, this is too confusing, so you should pass a box
** Why do they exist? They are "cheaper"
