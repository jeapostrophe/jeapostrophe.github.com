* Typing Data

* Recursive types
** Fundamental in computer science: trees and lists
** Ex: Types on length
** Can't have dif types, like empty and cons, one to combine them
** Package deal: names for new types, variants, and recursive defs
** Ex: family tree type
** Ex: cases judgment
** If datatypes are local, what is the type of something returned from one?
*** Could restrict if body expr couldn't be declared type
*** Actually, can't appear free
*** Actually, what if we returned two functions, creator and consumer
*** This is an object system

* Space for Datatype Variant Tags
** We NEED to store the variant
