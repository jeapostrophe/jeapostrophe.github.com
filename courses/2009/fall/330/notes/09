* Factorial in FAE
** Must add - and *
** Can't work, because 'fac' is not bound in body
* Add 'rec'
** Like with, it introduces a name

** What environment should it produce?
** One with a binding for 'fac' to a closure
** But that needs an env
** And so on
** The environment must be a cyclical structure
** Recursive vs. cyclic
* Recursive procedures vs values
