* Store passing style

* New 'box' value
* Implement newbox, setbox, openbox

* Env-passing is linear, but store is threaded
** Scope vs Extent
** Difference between names and values
** Some languages (C/C++) confuse them and destroy values when names go away

***

* We have mutable data structure, but not 'variables'
* How do we add 'set'?
** Just use env-lookup, but not store-lookup (l-value)
** Compare to C
* Interaction with function application?
