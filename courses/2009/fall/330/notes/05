* Review
** Write F1WAE BNF and define-type
* Deferring Substitutions
** subst is O(n)
** If there are n substs, then eval is O(n^2)
** Keep a list of future substitutions
** Evaluating an id now means looking it up
** Define DefrdSub type
** Augment interp contract
** Define lookup
** Augment interp
*** Error: give functions the entire current deferred substitutions
*** This is a bug: deferring substitutions is an optimization!
*** Static Scope: Syntactically delimited region
*** Dynamic Scope: The remainder of the execution
**** Entirely wrong: cannot be understood
** Fix interp
*** Look at the subst-based app rule
** Why do we never "undo" additions to the repository?
** How efficient is this? Can we do it better?
