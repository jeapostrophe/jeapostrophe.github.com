Q: What kind of simulations are important enough for number generation
to be truly random? If we use pseudo random algorithms for
cryptography, wouldn't that be sufficient for other applications?

Q: I also was a little confused by the poker test. Maybe I missed a
detail, but I'm unsure exactly what it says about a sequence of
numbers.

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

EX: Could you maybe create a concrete example for how the linear
feedback shift works? I understand that it's sort of a cycle of bits
but I'm still not sure I understand it entirely.
